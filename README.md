# Fallout New Vegas RTX Helper

An [NVSE](https://github.com/xNVSE/NVSE/releases/latest) helper plugin to make Fallout New Vegas more usable with [NVIDIA's RTX Remix](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/rtx-remix/releases/latest)

## Features

* Send lighting information to RTX Remix  
* Disable Culling  
* Disable render passes broken with RTX Remix

The [Fallout Alpha Rendering Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/80316) mod is also recommended to use alongside this, it fixes some rendering issues that confuse RTX Remix
